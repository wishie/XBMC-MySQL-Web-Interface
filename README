XBMC MySQL Web Interface
------------------------

This is a very simple web interface to display the movies in your XBMC library (from MySQL only).
I will eventually extend this to also support TV Shows.

The code is messy, not optimal, and may contain (many) bugs.

I have written this purely for my own use, but thought someone else might benefit from it.

The advantage to this interface, as opposed to the XBMC built-in Web Interface, is that XBMC doesnt have to be running to display your movies etc.

Some features, like the "Play In" and "Stop Playback" features obviously need XBMC to be running, though.

TODO (in order of priority):

1. Use JSON instead of deprecated HTTP API for 'play/stop' function
2. Tidy up the output (the HTML display)
3. ???
4. ???
5. Tidy up the code.


Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

1. Copy source folder to somewhere in your web server tree (example /var/www/ on Linux)
2. Edit config.php and access.php to your liking.
3. Create a symlink called 'Thumbnails' and point it at your XBMC thumbnails dir
4. Visit http://<webserver-ip>/medialists/

Please note, you CAN rename the dir from 'medialists' to whatever you want.
